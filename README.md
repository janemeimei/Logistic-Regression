# LogisticRegression

Introdution of Project

The project focuses on analyzing an advertising dataset that records whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement. The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can determine whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their features.

Summary of Project

Our analysis reveals that users who engage with ads tend to be those who spend less time on the Internet. By utilizing five key predictive factors—'Daily Time Spent on Site', 'Age', 'Area Income', 'Daily Internet Usage', and 'Male'—I developed a logistic regression model that achieves an impressive accuracy of 92% in predicting whether users will click on ads.

To enhance the click-through rate of ads, it is essential to further investigate the characteristics of the three user types who do not engage with ads. Additionally, for increasing conversion rates post-ad click, we recommend tailoring strategies based on the specific needs and preferences of users who demonstrate a higher propensity to click on ads. This targeted approach could lead to more effective ad campaigns and improved overall performance.
